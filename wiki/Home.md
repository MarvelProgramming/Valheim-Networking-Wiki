This wiki is centered around Valheim's netcode. The goal is to explore, in detail, the purpose of each component that makes up the [ZSystem](https://github.com/MarvelProgramming/Valheim-Networking-Wiki/wiki/ZSystem), and document any discoveries here. For a broader look at modding the game, have a look at the [Valheim Modding Wiki](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Wiki).
